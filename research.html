		  <h3>OUR ASPIRATION</h3>
			<!--Comment Out--
			<p>Gene  expression programs establish and maintain specific cell states. These programs are controlled by thousands of transcription factors, cofactors, and chromatin regulators, which &quot;extract&quot; the information stored in the shared genomic sequences of an individual organism in a cell-specific manner that in turn gives the cells particular functions and identities. We want to understand  how this fascinating process happens.<br>
			The DNA exists in cells in the form of chromatin in eukaryotes. Our laboratory studies how DNA-binding transcription factors, chromatin regulators and signaling molecules cooperate on chromatin, how regulatory DNA elements talk to each other, and how these transcription events associate with development, differentiation and diseases. We make use of single molecule tracking, fluorescence microscopy, epigenomics, biochemistry, and genome editing to study gene regulatory mechanisms. We are also interested in developing medical diagnostics and therapeutic interventions for human diseases that are associated with abnormal gene expression.</p>

			<p>Cells with the same genomic sequences can have distinct gene expression  profiles and generate numerous cell types and states. The overarching interest  of the laboratory is studying the molecular events that collaboratively turn on or off genes, i.e. transcription regulation, in the context of chromatin in  mammalian cells. <strong>Nuclear proteins are the major players in decoding the genome, i.e. controlling transcription activity. </strong>They include DNA-binding transcription factors, epigenetic regulators, and chromatin structural proteins that organize  chromatin in 3D and so on, which all act on selective regions of the genome in cell type specific manners. We strive to understand the molecular mechanisms by  which specificity is achieved. We are an interdisciplinary team particularly interested in <strong> depicting the kinetics and functional specificity of protein regulators interacting with the chromatinized DNA. </strong>We use a combination of biochemistry, genomics and single molecule microscopy methods to depict their sequence specificity, association with chromatin states, single molecule dynamics and super-resolution spatial distribution in the living cells. Such cross-disciplinary approaches can give us an integrated understanding on how cell-specific and tissue-specific transcription is achieved in normal cell growth and differentiation, and is misregulated in human diseases. </p>

		<h3>Our Projects</h3>
		<p>* Please contact Wulan to discuss details of the projects below.</p>	
		<div>
			<h4><strong>Single  Molecule Dynamics Of Transcription Regulatory Factors In Living Cells</strong></h4>
			<p>Transcription regulation is a dynamic process occurring in the confined  space of cellular nucleus in living cells. What are the timescales by which  factors locate and act on their specific targets? What are the factors  promoting or constraining search of targets? What is the spatial distribution  of chromatin interacting factors since chromatin is heterogenous in the  nucleus? Do factors within a complex act on their targets synchronously or  independently in living cells? There are many same kind of questions to be  answered. To probe these questions, we systematically use single molecule  fluorescence microscopy to image and track specific nuclear proteins in the  living cells. We use and develop quantitative analyses to measure kinetic  traits of protein factors such as diffusion constants, association rates,  dissociation rates, clustering, colocalizations and so on. </p>
</div>
		<div>
			<h4><strong>Mechanisms Of Pioneer Transcription Factor Action On Chromatin</strong></h4>
			<p>Chromatin accessibility is a common mechanism to control action of DNA-binding  transcription factors, with most transcription factors have no or weak  interaction with nucleosomal DNA targets. A selection of transcription factor  appear to have the capability to access nucleosomal DNA targets, named pioneer  transcription factor, and are often function during cell fate transition such  as differentiation and cell reprogramming. We are currently study the molecular  features of pioneer transcription factors and investigate mechanisms by which  pioneer transcription factor access nucleosomes and create open regions on  chromatin.   </p>
</div>
		<div>
			<h4><strong>Mechanisms Of Chromatin Organization Factor Action On Chromatin</strong></h4>
			<p>The spatial organization of chromatin in 3D is a key regulation mechanism for transcription activity. We focus on the protein factors that contribute to this higher order chromatin organization, and investigate mechanisms by which they establish specific long range regulatory interactions and topologically associated domains. </p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4><strong>Pluripotency, Differentiation, Reprogramming And Embryo Development</strong></h4>
			<p>Fate-changing  transcription factors play essential roles in development and reprogramming. We  employ cell culture systems, including mESC, hESC, primary fibroblast, and  cancer cell lines, as well as mouse early embryos to investigate mechanisms of  transcription regulation and cell fate regulation.  </p>

					<p><img src="images/research_imgs/FOXA2.gif" alt="Super-Resolution Cellular Imaging" width="247px" class="p">Limited by light diffraction, conventional optical microscopy can only achieve spatial resolution of a few hundred nanometers. Recently, a few emerging super-resolution techniques have broken this barrier and achieved spatial resolution as high as 10 nm, and thus opened a broad range of applications in life sciences. Our lab uses these techniques to probe static structures, such as three-dimensional structures of nuclei; as well as dynamic processes in the living cell. The study will lead to unprecedented visualization and deeper understanding of various life processes.</p>

BIOPIC will apply state-of-the-art high-throughput techniques to carry out functional genomics analysis of stem cells, human embryonic development and human diseases, especially cancers and infectious diseases. BIOPIC is capitalizing on new sequencing techniques, with a focus on the single cell genomics, transciptomics and epigenomics analysis. These developments will greatly facilitate advances in biological research, medical diagnosis, and personal medicine.</p>
