		  <h3>OUR ASPIRATION</h3>
			<p>Gene  expression programs establish and maintain specific cell states. These programs are controlled by thousands of transcription factors, cofactors, and chromatin regulators, which &quot;extract&quot; the information stored in the shared genomic sequences of an individual organism in a cell-specific manner that in turn gives the cells particular functions and identities. We want to understand  how this fascinating process happens.<br>
			The DNA exists in cells in the form of chromatin in eukaryotes. Our laboratory studies how DNA-binding transcription factors, chromatin regulators and signaling molecules cooperate on chromatin, how regulatory DNA elements talk to each other, and how these transcription events associate with development, differentiation and diseases. We make use of single molecule tracking, fluorescence microscopy, epigenomics, biochemistry, and genome editing to study gene regulatory mechanisms. We are also interested in developing medical diagnostics and therapeutic interventions for human diseases that are associated with abnormal gene expression.</p>

			  <h4>Fluorescence microscopy</h4>
			  <p>Beside of single molecule tracking, our lab uses a combination of other fluorescence microscopy including confocal, long time-lapse, photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM), and stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM). We use fluorescence in situ microscopy (FISH) methods to detect DNA and RNA in situ in cells. Wulan has developed CASFISH (Cas9-mediated fluorescence in situ hybridization), to detect genomic DNA with fluorescence in cells. </p>
			</div>
			<div>
			  <h4>Biochemistry & Epigenomics</h4>
			  <p>Our lab uses biochemistry and genomic methods to profile gene expression, transcription factors-chromatin association, and chromatin organization. We investigate protein-protein interactions, and post-translational modifications of transcription factors. We purify CRISPR/Cas9 complex from bacteria and fluorescently label it in test tubes. </p>
		  </div>
			<div>
			  <h4>CRISPR genome editing</h4>
			  <p> Our lab uses the genome editing tool CRISPR/Cas9 to knock in fluorescence tags to endogenous loci in the genome, knock out specific genes, and generate mutants at the endogenous loci. We use genome editing in both human embryonic stem cells and cancer cells. </p>

		<h3>Our Projects</h3>
		<p>* Please contact Wulan to discuss details of the projects below.</p>
		<p>With the over-arching goal of understanding transcription regulation mechanisms on chromatin, our research interest is currently focused on the functioning mechanisms and biophysical dynamics of DNA-binding transcription factors. We measure the association and dissociation kinetics of transcription factors to their target DNA in the context of chromatin and living cells. We investigate the spatial distributions of transcription factors, chromatin, other nuclear factors and transcription events. We generate synthetic transcription factors to modulate micro-scale chromatin organization and transcription activity. We develop tools for imaging chromatin organization. We are currently interested in studying key transcription factors in hESC pluripotency, differentiation, and reprogramming.

			<p>The laboratory mainly uses research methods such as single-molecule fluorescence imaging and genomics, focusing on the temporal and spatial dynamics of molecules involved in gene regulation events in cells, combining DNA sequence characteristics, epigenetic characteristics, chromatin spatial conformation and other multiple dimensions to transcription The regulation mechanism is studied to explain the molecular mechanism of gene transcription regulation and chromatin regulation during development and disease occurrence. The main technologies used and developed in the laboratory include： <br><br>(1) Super-resolution cellular imaging and single molecule tracking <br>(2) High-throughput sequencing <br>(3) Optogenetic Control <br><br>Our lab will take advantage of these technologies to conduct fundamental research in biochemistry, biophysics, molecular biology and cell biology, with the hope of providing an understanding of stem cells, cancers, and infectious and metabolic diseases. <br></p>

					<p><img src="images/research_imgs/FOXA2.gif" alt="Super-Resolution Cellular Imaging" width="247px" class="p">Limited by light diffraction, conventional optical microscopy can only achieve spatial resolution of a few hundred nanometers. Recently, a few emerging super-resolution techniques have broken this barrier and achieved spatial resolution as high as 10 nm, and thus opened a broad range of applications in life sciences. Our lab uses these techniques to probe static structures, such as three-dimensional structures of nuclei; as well as dynamic processes in the living cell. The study will lead to unprecedented visualization and deeper understanding of various life processes.</p>

					<p><img src="images/research_imgs/chip-seq.jpg" alt="High Throughput Sequencing"  width="260px" class="p">High-throughput DNA sequencing has revolutionized biological and medical research, offering unprecedented opportunities to systematically dissect functional elements in genome sequences and gene regulation networks. BIOPIC will apply state-of-the-art high-throughput techniques to carry out functional genomics analysis of stem cells, human embryonic development and human diseases, especially cancers and infectious diseases. BIOPIC is capitalizing on new sequencing techniques, with a focus on the single cell genomics, transciptomics and epigenomics analysis. These developments will greatly facilitate advances in biological research, medical diagnosis, and personal medicine.</p>

These optogenetic approaches allow researchers to dictate biological signaling with exquisite spatial and temporal precision. The ability to remotely and non-invasively trigger signal transduction has led to unparalleled breakthroughs in neuroscience, cardiology and cell biology. </p>
