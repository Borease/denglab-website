			<p>The laboratory mainly uses research methods such as single-molecule fluorescence imaging and genomics, focusing on the temporal and spatial dynamics of molecules involved in gene regulation events in cells, combining DNA sequence characteristics, epigenetic characteristics, chromatin spatial conformation and other multiple dimensions to transcription The regulation mechanism is studied to explain the molecular mechanism of gene transcription regulation and chromatin regulation during development and disease occurrence. The main technologies used and developed in the laboratory include： <br><br>(1) Super-resolution cellular imaging and single molecule tracking <br>(2) High-throughput sequencing <br>(3) Optogenetic Control <br><br>Our lab will take advantage of these technologies to conduct fundamental research in biochemistry, biophysics, molecular biology and cell biology, with the hope of providing an understanding of stem cells, cancers, and infectious and metabolic diseases. <br></p>

			<p><img src="images/research_imgs/FOXA2.gif" alt="Super-Resolution Cellular Imaging" width="247px" class="p">Limited by light diffraction, conventional optical microscopy can only achieve spatial resolution of a few hundred nanometers. Recently, a few emerging super-resolution techniques have broken this barrier and achieved spatial resolution as high as 10 nm, and thus opened a broad range of applications in life sciences. Our lab uses these techniques to probe static structures, such as three-dimensional structures of nuclei; as well as dynamic processes in the living cell. The study will lead to unprecedented visualization and deeper understanding of various life processes.</p>

			<p><img src="images/research_imgs/chip-seq.jpg" alt="High Throughput Sequencing"  width="260px" class="p">High-throughput DNA sequencing has revolutionized biological and medical research, offering unprecedented opportunities to systematically dissect functional elements in genome sequences and gene regulation networks. BIOPIC will apply state-of-the-art high-throughput techniques to carry out functional genomics analysis of stem cells, human embryonic development and human diseases, especially cancers and infectious diseases. BIOPIC is capitalizing on new sequencing techniques, with a focus on the single cell genomics, transciptomics and epigenomics analysis. These developments will greatly facilitate advances in biological research, medical diagnosis, and personal medicine.</p>

			<p><img src="images/research_imgs/modifyDNA.jpg" alt="modifyDNA" width="230px" class="p">Over the past 10 years, advancements in our understanding of photoactivated proteins have enabled genetic control of cellular events through light. These optogenetic approaches allow researchers to dictate biological signaling with exquisite spatial and temporal precision. The ability to remotely and non-invasively trigger signal transduction has led to unparalleled breakthroughs in neuroscience, cardiology and cell biology. </p>
